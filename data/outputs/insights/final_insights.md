# Delhi Air Quality: Final Insights (2022–2025)

This section summarizes the key learnings derived from the overall analysis of Delhi’s AQI data. The focus is on broader patterns, main drivers of pollution, and consistent trends across years.


---

## 1. Overall Air Quality Situation

- Around **50–55% of days** fall under **Poor or worse AQI**
- This means bad air is **very common**, not rare
- Truly clean air days are **less than half the year**

**What this tells us:**  
Delhi’s air pollution is not an occasional problem, it is something people live with regularly.

---

## 2. Seasonal Pattern in Pollution

- AQI follows a **very clear seasonal pattern**
- **Worst months:** Winter (November–January)
- **Best months:** Monsoon (July–September)
- Numbers show that:
  - The **worst month has almost 4× higher AQI** than the cleanest month

**What this tells us:**  
Season and weather matter much more than small daily changes.

---

## 3. Why Winter Is the Worst

During winter:
- Temperatures are lower
- Wind movement is weak
- Temperature inversion happens often

Because of this:
- Pollutants get trapped near the ground
- AQI rises quickly and stays high
- Pollution episodes last longer

**What this tells us:**  
Winter creates perfect conditions for pollution to build up and stay.

---

## 4. Year-to-Year Behaviour

- AQI values change slightly each year
- But the **overall pattern stays the same every year**:
  - Very bad winters
  - Gradual improvement after winter
  - Cleanest air during monsoon

**What this tells us:**  
Even though numbers change, the structure of Delhi’s pollution problem does not.

---

## 5. Effect of Wind

- Windy days clearly have **much lower AQI**
- Calm days have much worse pollution

From the analysis:
- Windy days show around **40–45% lower AQI** compared to calm days

**What this tells us:**  
Wind helps spread pollutants and naturally improves air quality.

---

## 6. Effect of Rain

- AQI is much lower on rainy days
- Rain removes pollutants from the air directly

From the numbers:
- Rainy days show around **45–50% lower AQI** compared to dry days

But:
- This effect is **temporary**
- AQI rises again once rain stops

**What this tells us:**  
Rain helps a lot, but only for a short time.

---

## 7. Diwali and Pollution

- Diwali usually leads to a noticeable AQI increase
- On average, AQI increases by **15–20%** during Diwali

However:
- In some years, AQI is already very high before Diwali
- In those cases, weather and background smog matter more than fireworks

**What this tells us:**  
Diwali adds to pollution, but its impact depends on existing conditions.

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

- Delhi has unhealthy air on **about half the days every year**
- Winter is consistently the most polluted season
- Wind and rain reduce pollution **a lot**, but only temporarily
- Diwali increases AQI by **15–20%**
- The worst month’s AQI is **almost 4×** the cleanest month

---

## Final Conclusion

Delhi’s air pollution problem is long-term and strongly seasonal. Natural factors like wind and rain can reduce pollution for short periods, but they do not fix the root causes. Without serious control of pollution sources, severe winter pollution will continue year after year.
