## From Chart 1: AQI Timeline

**Visualization:**  
[View Chart 1 – AQI Timeline](outputs/01_aqi_timeline.png)

**Question:**  
When are pollution spikes observed?

**Observation:**  
The AQI timeline shows sharp and repeated spikes during the winter months, particularly between November and January. These spikes are significantly higher than AQI levels observed during other times of the year.

**Inference / Conclusion:**  
Pollution spikes occur mainly in winter, indicating that seasonal factors strongly influence air quality. Winter atmospheric conditions trap pollutants, leading to sudden and severe AQI increases.

## From Chart 2: Monthly Average AQI

**Visualization:**

**Question:**  
Which months consistently have bad air quality?

**Observation:**  
Monthly averages reveal that November, December, and January consistently record the highest AQI values. In contrast, July and August show the lowest AQI levels.

**Inference / Conclusion:**  
Air quality is consistently worst during winter months and best during the monsoon season. Seasonal weather patterns play a dominant role in determining pollution levels.

## From Chart 3: AQI Distribution by Season

**Visualization:**  
[View Chart 3 – AQI Distribution by Season](outputs/03_seasonal_boxplots.png)

**Question:**  
How does AQI vary across different seasons?

**Observation:**  
Winter shows the highest median AQI and the widest spread, indicating both severe and unstable pollution levels. Monsoon months display the lowest and most stable AQI, while autumn shows rising AQI with high variability.

**Inference / Conclusion:**  
Winter pollution is not only severe but also highly variable, making it the most critical season for air quality concerns. Monsoon conditions help stabilize and reduce pollution.

## From Chart 4: AQI Comparison (2023 vs 2024)

**Visualization:**

**Question:**  
Is air quality in 2024 better or worse than in 2023?

**Observation:**  
The AQI trends for 2023 and 2024 largely overlap, following similar seasonal patterns. However, 2024 shows slightly lower pollution peaks during winter months.

**Inference / Conclusion:**  
Air quality in 2024 appears marginally better than in 2023, but the improvement is limited. Seasonal pollution patterns remain largely unchanged year-on-year.

## From Chart 5: Wind Speed vs AQI

**Visualization:**  
[View Chart 5 – Wind Speed vs AQI](outputs/05_wind_vs_aqi.png)

**Question:**  
Does wind reduce pollution levels?

**Observation:**  
The scatter plot shows a negative correlation between wind speed and AQI. Higher wind speeds are generally associated with lower AQI values.

**Inference / Conclusion:**  
Wind helps disperse pollutants, leading to improved air quality. However, the wide spread of data points suggests that wind alone does not fully control pollution levels.

## From Chart 6: Impact of Rain on AQI

**Visualization:**  
[View Chart 6 – Rain Impact on AQI](outputs/06_rain_impact.png)

**Question:**  
How effective is rain at cleaning the air?

**Observation:**  
Average AQI levels are noticeably lower on days following rainfall compared to days without rain. The calculated reduction percentage confirms a measurable decrease in pollution after rain.

**Inference / Conclusion:**  
Rain effectively reduces air pollution by washing out particulate matter, but the effect is temporary. Pollution levels do not drop to safe limits, indicating that rain provides short-term relief rather than a permanent solution.

## From Chart 7: Temperature vs AQI Correlation

**Visualization:**  
[View Chart 7 – Temperature vs AQI Correlation](outputs/07_temp_correlation.png)

**Question:**  
Why is winter pollution worse?

**Observation:**  
The temperature vs AQI plot shows a moderate negative correlation, with higher AQI levels occurring at lower temperatures. AQI decreases as temperature rises to moderate levels and increases slightly at very high temperatures.

**Inference / Conclusion:**  
Winter pollution is worse due to low temperatures causing temperature inversion and reduced air mixing. These conditions trap pollutants near the surface, resulting in elevated AQI levels.
